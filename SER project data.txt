# 🎯 GOAL (Final Outcome)

Build a **Speech Emotion Recognition system** that:

* Uses **MFCC + Spectrograms**
* Compares **CNN vs CNN-LSTM vs Transformer (optional)**
* Is **dataset-robust**
* Is **API-ready**
* Has **clear evaluation, ablations, and documentation**

This is the kind of project recruiters **ask questions about**.

# 🧱 PHASE 1 — Foundations (Do this properly)

## 1️⃣ Audio & Speech Fundamentals (Must know deeply)

You should be able to **explain** these in interviews:

* Sampling rate
* Nyquist theorem
* Windowing (Hamming, Hann)
* FFT
* Mel scale
* MFCC pipeline (step-by-step)
* Delta & Delta-Delta MFCCs
* Spectrogram vs Mel-spectrogram

📌 **Deliverable:**
Write a short markdown doc:

> “How MFCCs represent human emotion”

## 2️⃣ Dataset Mastery (RAVDESS)

Go beyond loading files.

* Emotion distribution imbalance
* Gender bias analysis
* Actor leakage prevention
* Speaker-independent splitting
* Emotion intensity impact

📌 **Deliverables:**

## 3️⃣ CNN + LSTM (Temporal Modeling)

Pipeline:

> CNN → LSTM → Dense

Why?

* CNN → spatial features
* LSTM → temporal emotion patterns

📌 **Deliverables:**

* CNN vs CNN-LSTM comparison
* Training curves
* Error analysis

# 🧠 PHASE 4 — Advanced Improvements (Resume Gold)

## 🔥 Data Augmentation (VERY IMPORTANT)

* Noise injection
* Pitch shifting
* Time stretching
* Room impulse simulation

📌 Show improvement before & after augmentation.

---

## 🔥 Attention Mechanism (Optional but impressive)

* Attention over time steps
* Emotion-salient frame weighting

---

## 🔥 Cross-Dataset Evaluation

Test trained model on:

* CREMA-D (if time permits)

📌 Shows **generalization**, recruiters love this.

---

# 🧪 PHASE 5 — Evaluation & Research Thinking

You MUST include:

* Accuracy
* Precision / Recall / F1
* Confusion matrix
* Emotion-wise analysis
* Gender bias check
* Speaker leakage test

📌 **Deliverable:**
A polished **Results & Discussion** notebook.

# 🚀 PHASE 6 — Production-Ready Model (For API Handoff)

Your friend will love this part.

## 1️⃣ Model Packaging

* Torch / Keras model
* Config file
* Preprocessing pipeline
* Versioned weights

## 2️⃣ Inference Pipeline

* Real-time audio input
* Sliding window prediction
* Confidence scoring

📌 Output:

```json
{
  "emotion": "happy",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "top_3": ["happy", "calm", "neutral"]
}
```

---

# 🧩 PHASE 7 — Documentation & Resume Story

## README MUST INCLUDE:

* Problem statement
* Dataset description
* Model architectures
* Experiments
* Results
* Future work
